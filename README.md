# SQL-employee-tracker

## Description
The purpose of this application is to build a command-line application that serves as a content management system, allowing a user to view a database of the employees, roles, and departments that are a part of a fictional business. This application uses Inquirer, Node.js and MySQL in order to accept user input in the command-line, allow a user to add/alter information in the database, and to query specific information from the aforementioned database. A schema file is used to create the 3 included  tables using a MySQL source command in the terminal, and a seeds file is used to populate data in the tables via a source command. The employee tracker application also includes additional functionality that will allow users to add a new department, add a new role, add a new employee, and update an existing employee.
